# HINDI-WORD-CLOCK
A word clock is a type of clock that displays the time using words rather than numbers. Instead of using traditional clock hands or digital numbers, a word clock uses a grid of letters that light up to spell out the current time in words.
We will discuss how to make a Word Clock in Hindi with Arduino Nano and RTC module and will fabricate a pcb for the same.
